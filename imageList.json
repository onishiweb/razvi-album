When the paramedic arrived she immediately placed the defibrillator on his chest to try and shock the heart back into action, which she did this on several occasions. A couple of minutes later a full ambulance crew arrived and took over, and he lay on court for a further 20 minutes whilst they also continued treatment. He was then taken off in the ambulance and had technically died en route as he arrived at St.Georges A&E. He was immediately rushed into the resuscitation unit and revived, but spent the next 3 months in intensive care, followed by a further 6 months in a rehab unit. However, brain damage had occurred causing both short term and long term memory loss. Jimmi managed though by writing down all the tasks he had to do and had done in a diary, which became his bible. During this period his wife was having fertility treatment as they had been trying to have children and she did conceive twin girls, and although he had had a defibrillator connected to his heart which kicked in when necessary and kept him alive for a further 3 years, Jimmi sadly passed away 2 weeks before the twins 2nd birthday. The picture which you are looking at is his legacy, this is as real as it gets."

I have to admit to being quite pleased with it as I had done next to no preparation and very little running in the weeks leading up to it. If I'm honest had it not been for the fact that I had committed to Simon to run it I'm sure I would have backed out. Running / jogging is something that I have done for a some years and it is something that I recall doing at junior school, so about age 9 or 10, when I would run to school from where we used to live (about three quarters of a mile) and time myself for the sheer hell of it. Going back 45 years you didn't see too many brown people running unless there was a herd of DM wearing, knuckle duster wielding yob skinheads chasing them! ... but I enjoyed running and seemed to remember being picked for the cross country school team (only once!). It is a challenge nowadays as the heart still wants to get out there and run and run and run but the body simply rolls over in bed and pulls the duvet over my head! I guess it comes as no surprise to know that Forrest Gump is one of my all time favourite films... some might say I remind them of him!"

More challenging to this though, was the many years I kept looking trying to find a solution to his mental health problem, when one day \"out of the blue\" Ruth told me that there is no miracle cure, and that I should just take one day at a time, even one minute at a time, and that that is all you can do. That day heralded the dawning of a new understanding and realisation on my part, which has probably helped us both."

You posses the best and worst parts of me. I knew we were kindred souls from the moment we met. You empathize with butterflies and snails, you plead their case in the court of public opinion at the park. You have written best selling graphic novels on the corner of dinner napkins, conducted symphonies in the bathtub. I have watched you warm the hearts of strangers with your feats of thoughtfulness in the schoolyard. It's these very characteristics that makes you a Rizvi and a Smith. It's what Baba and your father have in spades. The world needs more hustlers, writers, poets, thinkers, and lovers. I implore you to never stop being what makes you uniquely you. The world needs more Ayden Ali's!"

She would protest ... Ashraf ... Ashraf Stop, I’m cooking, I’m folding laundry, I’m cutting onions... but he would tell her to dance with him, sing with him, forget this cramped apartment, this cold lonely country that he had brought her to, forgive him for taking her away from everything she knew. All without saying any of those words. Instead he would plant a kiss on her neck and rest his head on her shoulder He would tell her his new business idea or the plot to a new Amitab Bachaan movie. He would then drag her into the middle of the living room and put the music up a decibel louder and serenade her and tell her she was his Jaan -E-Ash (his life) and she would smile and laugh and tell him to wash up and wake up, this isn’t a movie and then go back to her mundane chore but this time she would be smiling ear to ear , never realizing that we were watching, we were listening and we were falling in love with their love . He passed away on their wedding anniversary 4 years ago, a day before Valentine’s day. How did the days steal you from us. I remember the smell of frying onions, the shine of linoleum floor, the sound of Lata’s soulful voice calling her love back , time is a thief that never gets caught. Love you Deddy, Mummy misses you.

This despite a major obstacle - my parents. Who were against my marriage to Ruth on religious and cultural grounds, and which almost broke us up for good. However, years on, I understand and now respect what it meant to them, and just how difficult it must also have been for them at the time to see their son marry outside of their blind faith and strong genuine beliefs. Both my parents were staunch practising Muslims, but religion I believe has to come from the heart, and so I have no regrets and would do the same again, despite all the heartache and anguish caused on both sides. If the world is to be a better place then religious tolerance has a major role to play, and in my own unique way I played my part, and proved that just because one is of a different faith does not mean that we are not human."

Yet it was 16 years ago yesterday that we stood in front of everyone we loved and chose feelings not reasons to embark into uncharted territories. Yes we were in love but that isn't always enough. I'm sure many in attendance on that day by the sea questioned our unions longevity. But they never knew how to dress for the weather. You in your muted blues and greys and your Irish stoicism. Me in my Bollywood technicolor hues and immigrant heart. I love you my pragmatic fatalist! "
